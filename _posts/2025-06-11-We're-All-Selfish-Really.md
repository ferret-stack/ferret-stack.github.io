rush hour train
stopped at the station
"train is cancelled!"
said the driver

I wondered why
as my anger brewed
"trespasser on tracks!"
said the driver

such selfish behaviour
making me late home
"for fuck sake"
huffing and puffing

So
<p style="margin:60px;">I</p>
<p style="margin:100px; letter-spacing:10">ran</p>
<p style="margin:180px;">across</p>
<p style="margin:250px;">the</p>
<p style="margin:300px;">platform.</p>
<p style="margin:300px;">Then</p>
<p style="margin:300px;">sat</p>
<p style="margin:300px;">back</p>
<span style="margin:300px;">down</span>

Leaving an empty can of beer by my seat for someone else to pick up.

I guess that we're all selfish, really.
