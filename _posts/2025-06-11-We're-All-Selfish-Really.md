rush hour train<br>
stopped at the station<br>
"train is cancelled!"<br>
said the driver<br>

<p>I wondered why
as my anger brewed
"trespasser on tracks!"
said the driver</p>

<p such selfish behaviour
making me late home
"for fuck sake"
huffing and puffing</p>

<p>So
<span style="margin:60px;">I</span><br>
<span style="margin:100px; letter-spacing:10">ran</span><br>
<span style="margin:180px;">across</span><br>
<span style="margin:250px;">the</span><br>
<span style="margin:300px;">platform.</span><br>
<span style="margin:300px;">Then</span><br>
<span style="margin:300px;">sat</span><br>
<span style="margin:300px;">back</span><br>
<span style="margin:300px;">down</span><br></p>

<p>Leaving an empty can of beer by my seat for someone else to pick up.

I guess that we're all selfish, really.</p>
