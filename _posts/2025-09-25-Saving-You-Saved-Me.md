It arrived in a cardboard box with holes punched through the sides, anxious but willing. I had saved it from a situation I prefer not to recall, and perhaps that's why the seller had been so eager to let it go. It had three splotches on his nose and would sleep in a perfect spiral, as if following some geometric principle I couldn't grasp. The pattern made sense to it, and I trusted that understanding.

For weeks it would not play. Real ferrets, I had read, are creatures of boundless energy, but this one moved with a strange economy, each gesture calculated. When I dangled toys before it, it regarded them with what I can only describe as polite bewilderment, the way a diplomat might examine a foreign currency of no use in his own country.

"You must be very patient," I found myself saying to it one evening, though I wasn't sure if I was offering comfort or asking for it. It had positioned itself precisely in the centre of its cage laying on its front and was staring at me. A friendly smile and sparkle in its eye.

The change came gradually. First, it began to follow me from room to room, always maintaining the same careful distance - close enough to observe, far enough to flee. Then one morning I woke to find it had somehow opened its cage and was sitting beside my bed, waiting. Not with a pet's eager anticipation, but with the patience of someone keeping an appointment.

I did not like the box it came in, and though I had significantly upgraded its cage for its comfort, I did not like the cage either. As the change became more pronounced, the time spent in its cage grew shorter and shorter. Toys still confused it, but we had a mutual understanding on how to play with them. At any rate, it was far more concerned with climbing up my leg and being held than with toys. We ditched the cage, except for where it slept, and both became more free.

The morning I found the cage empty and the house door ajar, something broke open in my chest. I ran into the street in nothing but underwear, rain soaking through to my skin and the gravel piercing my feet, calling its name into the grey dawn. Three hours I searched, checking under cars, behind dumpsters, anywhere a small body might hide or be hiding. It had to shelter itself from the rain, because I was unable to. Goosebumps on my legs, nipples hard, and my heart breaking. I understood then how completely I had been claimed - not just as an owner, but as something far more desperate. I was its sanctuary, and I had failed.

It saw me before I saw it. Emerging from some plant bed soaked and shivering, just as I was, it ran directly to me with a recognition that felt like coming home and it bit my ankle. Alerting me? Disciplining me? I scooped it up, both of us trembling and hearts mending, I realised that whatever had been broken in its past was also broken in me. 

"You've been on an adventure," I said to it. I could read the reply in its eyes, 'it's only an adventure if I'm with you.' I understood.

I often catch myself speaking to it as if were a person pretending to be an animal, rather than the other way round. I have tamed it, and it has tamed me; we are responsible for each other. Though taming suggests a wildness conquered, what we have instead is a mutual bewilderment - two beings who have agreed to a contract neither of us can quite read, bound by the strange gravity of having nowhere else to go.

At night, when it curls against my chest, I feel the weight of being someone's entire universe, and I understand that love and captivity are sometimes indistinguishable, even when the cage door stays open.

But now he is gone. Torn from my arms through innocent means - a statement in the contract we shared that could not be escaped. We knew the clause was there, but didn't know how or when it would be enacted.

He is lost. And so am I.
