rush hour train
stopped at the station
"train is cancelled!"
said the driver

I wondered why
as my anger brewed
"trespasser on tracks!"
said the driver

such selfish behaviour
making me late home
"for fuck sake"
huffing and puffing

So
<span style="margin:60px;">I</span>
<span style="margin:100px; letter-spacing:10">ran</span>
<span style="margin:180px;">across</span>
<span style="margin:250px;">the</span>
<span style="margin:300px;">platform.</span>
<span style="margin:300px;">Then</span>
<span style="margin:300px;">sat</span>
<span style="margin:300px;">back</span>
<span style="margin:300px;">down</span>

Leaving an empty can of beer by my seat for someone else to pick up.

I guess that we're all selfish, really.
