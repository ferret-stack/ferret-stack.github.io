title: A Soviet, An American, and a Japanese Walk into a Pen Case

The three pens I have inked up for the upcoming fortnight are all pens that I bought while I was studying my undergraduate degree. 

Two of these pens represent a somewhat bipolar world order. The first, a Soyuz fountain pen that was made in the Soviet union, and of which bears a striking golden resemblance to a pen by a famous German manufacturer. The other pen is perhaps one of the most iconic and famous American pens of the 20th century. 

The third and final pen I have in my arsenal (thankfully not a nuclear one) is a Japanese pen that has a juuuiiicy wet nib with pencil-like feedback made by Sailor.

## Soyuz Magpie Montblanc
**Specifications:**
- Filling System: Captured converter
- Nib: Medium (I guess)
- Price Range: Depends
- Ink: <span style="color:midnightblue;">Diamine Twilight</span>

My undergraduate degree was in Politics, Philosophy, and Economics. During my time at university I took three modules that had some sort of focus on Russia and/or the Soviet Union, and while I came to learn a lot about the political, philosophical, and economical aspects of that region throughout time, I found my pen knowledge lacking. 

So I hopped online and sought to change that. 

There is some information out there about vintage Russian/Soviet fountain pens, and of course there are modern Russian manufacturers such as Benu (although I am aware that they have since moved their operations). The company that appeared the most in a vintage sense seemed to be a brand called Soyuz. 

From my surface level research, Soyuz made pens that would commemorate certain space missions, and would often wear bright metallic colours on their barrels. The one I have is gold, but I have seen pictures of this same model, but in silver. 

This pen has fine lines that run down the barrel. They're not large or deep enough to give a proper texture, but you can definitely feel them when you run your fingers over them. Equally, from a distance, you can't see them too well (and the shininess of the gold probably doesn't help with this), but when you look close up, it does give a refined look to the pen. 

The nib is where this pen gets *really* interesting. As I alluded to above, the design of this pen seems to take inspiration from a certain German pen manufacturer and looks very similar to the Montblanc 22. Except, with its metallic shine, probably marketed towards magpies. 

So there. I will now refer to this pen in my collection as the Magpie Montblanc, unless someone is able to give me the correct model name. This, however, I fear is perhaps lost to history.

The nib is wet and juicy. I don't think it's gold, but there is some flex to it. While it might be down to my writing angle as a left-handed--over-writer, I get a really smooth down stroke, but a subtle feedback whenever the pen rests itself on the left tine. It's rather nice!

The pen fills with a captured-converter. There is no removing this thing, and even if you did, the barrel would no longer connect to the grip section because the threads are on the converter. 

**Who this pen is for:** History buffs

## Esterbrook J
**Specifications:**
- Filling System: Lever-fill
- Nib: Firm Fine / 2556
- Price Range: Depends
- Ink: <span style="color:brown;">Diamine Ancient Copper</span>

The Esterbrook J is perhaps one of the most famous vintage pens out there, maybe only rivalled by the Parker Vacumatic or 51 pens.

It is a celluloid pen that was manufactured around the mid-20th century and was revolutionary due to its screw-in *renew point* nibs, which makes it super easy to hot-swap nibs into the barrel. Esterbrook provided nib options like your typical extra fine to broad sizes, varying rigidity/flex, and specialised nibs for things like accounting and shorthand.

Apparently there were over 100 different nib options! 

The nib I have in this pen is marked **2556**, which is up there as one of the most common nibs and is a firm fine. The [2] prefix indicates that it is one of the regular use nibs as part of their *Master Series* (aka *2000 Series*), which designates it as a steel nib with higher quality than the more economical *1000 Series*. 

Within each series, the second digit indicates the general nib type, with [5] characterising it as a general writing nib.

I haven't inked this pen up for a very long time (it appears I was very diligent cleaning it last time - thankfully!) and after researching this pen and all the different nibs, I think I will be trying to pick up some more of these in the future. Whether different nibs or an entire new pen body to see if I could collect some more colourways. 

This terracotta colour is absolutely gorgeous though!

My *only* gripe with this pen is that I find it a touch too small to use unposted, but too large to use posted. Not that I'm much of a fan of capping my pen anyway. It's only lacking by a very minute scale; if it was about 1-2cm longer then it would be perfect.

**Who this pen is for:** Those who love to tinker and personalise their pens

## Taccia Spectrum
**Specifications:**
- Filling System: Converter
- Nib: Broad
- Price Range: Unsure
- Ink: <span style="color:yellowgreen;">Rohrer & Klinger Alt Gold Grun</span>

Man, I could think of so many horrible words / terms to describe this ink.

Despite green and yellow being perhaps my two least favourite colours, I really like this baby-poo green-yellow. 

The nib shows the colour off brilliantly. It is a very wet broad nib and it is a pleasure to see the ink being laid onto the page while writing. You can see the flow of the capillary action on the paper - a rich and dark pooling that gently lightens up as it settles.

What I also really enjoy about using this pen is that the feedback as a gorgeous pencil-like characteristic to it.

I had a bit of an accident when inking this pen up. Because Taccia nibs are manufactured by Sailor, and the converter looked as though it was a Sailor proprietary fit, I thought I could use this in my Sailor Pro Gear (makes sense, right?)

I've unfortunately misplaced my Sailor converter and I've been wanting to ink the Pro Gear up for a while. When I put it in the Sailor, the converter held for a while... right up until the moment I put it into the bottle of ink... **Plop!**

The nib unit fell into the ink and I had to fish it out with my fingers, which was as finicky as it was messy. 

If only this happened with a bright blue or pretty pink shimmer. Alas. I like the ink, but not enough to wear it on my fingers. 

## Conclusion
This fortnight's trio represents more than just writing instruments — they're a journey through history and craftsmanship spanning three continents. 

![All pens side by side](/assets/images/bipolar/all_side.jpg)

From the enigmatic Soviet Soyuz "Magpie Montblanc" with its intriguing resemblance to German luxury, to the quintessentially American Esterbrook J with its innovative hot-swappable nibs, and finally to the Japanese Taccia Spectrum with its Sailor-made nib delivering that distinctive pencil-like feedback.

Each pen carries its own story—tales of cold war manufacturing, mid-century American innovation, and Japanese precision. And each delivers a unique writing experience, from the subtle flex of the Soyuz to the firm reliability of the Esterbrook to the juicy wetness of the Taccia.
