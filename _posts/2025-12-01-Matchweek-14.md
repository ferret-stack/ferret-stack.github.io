## 📊 <strong>Matchweek 13 Review</strong>

Before we dive in, let's review how last week's portfolio performed:

| Bet | Odds | Stake | Result | P/L |
|-----|------|-------|--------|-----|
| Brighton to Win | 2.72 | 5.7% | ✅ WON | +9.8 |
| Leeds to Win | 11.0 | 2.9% | ❌ LOST | -2.9 |
| Newcastle to Win | 2.50 | 5.0% | ✅ WON | +7.5 |
| Spurs to Win | 2.20 | 4.5% | ❌ LOST | -4.5 |
| Villa/Wolves O2.5 | 1.75 | 4.8% | ❌ LOST | -4.8 |
| Sunderland/Bournemouth O2.5 | 1.91 | 3.1% | ✅ WON | +2.8 |
| West Ham to Win | 3.75 | 1.5% | ❌ LOST | -1.5 |
| **TOTAL** | - | **27.5%** | **3/7** | **+6.4 units** |

A profitable week despite going 3/7 on individual bets. Our premium picks delivered: **Brighton cruised to a 2-0 win at Forest** (exactly as the ELO model predicted), and **Newcastle destroyed Everton 4-1** at Goodison. The Sunderland/Bournemouth Over 2.5 came in with 5 goals in a thrilling 3-2.

The misses were instructive. **Spurs' home woes continued** as they fell 1-2 to Fulham — their striker crisis is crippling their attacking output. **Villa 1-0 Wolves** was the frustrating one — Kamara's stunner was the only goal in a cagey West Midlands derby. And **Leeds came agonisingly close** at the Etihad, going down 3-2 after being 2-0 down.

The Chelsea vs Arsenal 1-1 draw? **We called it exactly right for Super 6.** Chalobah headed Chelsea ahead, Merino equalised. Sometimes the model just works.

### 🧩 <strong>Why This Has Value</strong>

<div class="callout">
This is a <strong>Band 1</strong> fixture with just 17 ELO points separating the sides (Bournemouth 1818 vs Everton 1801). In Band 1 fixtures across 469 matches, the weaker away team wins <strong>35.82%</strong> of the time. Bookmakers have Everton at just 28.25% implied — that's a massive <strong>27% edge</strong>.
</div>

### 📈 <strong>The Model Says</strong>

<div class="callout">
Band 1 (ELO diff 0-50) across 469 matches:<br>
P(Weaker Away Team Wins) = 0.3582<br>
→ Fair odds = 1 / 0.3582 = 2.79<br>
Bookmaker offering 3.54 = <strong>+26.8% EV</strong>
</div>

### ⚽ <strong>Form Context</strong>

Bournemouth are reeling after a 4-0 hammering at Aston Villa that ended their 8-game unbeaten run. They've lost both senior strikers — Ünal (ACL, season) and Evanilson (fractured metatarsal). Their form rating has crashed to 2.0/10 with -30 ELO over their last 5 games.

Everton beat Fulham 2-0 at the weekend and have quietly improved under Moyes. They're 13th with a stable form rating of 4.1/10. Dewsbury-Hall is back from suspension and Ndiaye is in good form. At 3.54, the market is massively underpricing the Toffees.

### 🏥 <strong>Team News</strong>

Bournemouth are missing Ünal (ACL) and Evanilson (metatarsal) — a striker crisis. Cook (shoulder) and Christie (knee) also out. Everton have Branthwaite (hamstring surgery) and Patterson (foot) unavailable, but the squad is otherwise healthy.

### 💼 <strong>Portfolio Play</strong>

Standalone bet. Our highest-EV play of the week.

## 🔥 <strong>PREMIUM PICK:</strong> Brighton vs Aston Villa — <em>Aston Villa to Win</em>

### 🧩 <strong>Why This Has Value</strong>

<div class="callout">
Aston Villa hold a <strong>40-point ELO advantage</strong> over Brighton, placing this in <strong>Band 1</strong> (0-50 difference). In Band 1 fixtures across 469 matches, the ELO-stronger team wins <strong>37.31%</strong> of the time. Bookmakers have Villa at just 30.86% implied — that's a <strong>21% edge</strong>.
</div>

### 📈 <strong>The Model Says</strong>

<div class="callout">
Band 1 (ELO diff 0-50) across 469 matches:<br>
P(Stronger Team Wins) = 0.3731<br>
→ Fair odds = 1 / 0.3731 = 2.68<br>
Bookmaker offering 3.24 = <strong>+20.9% EV</strong>
</div>

### ⚽ <strong>Form Context</strong>

Villa are flying. They've won 7 of their last 8 Premier League games and sit 3rd in the table after Kamara's stunner beat Wolves at the weekend. Their ELO has climbed 32 points over 10 games. Unai Emery has this team purring — they beat Man City 1-0 at home and Liverpool 2-0 at Anfield in recent weeks.

Brighton are a solid outfit but their away form is where Villa can exploit them. The Seagulls are 1W-2D-3L on the road this season despite sitting 5th overall. At home they're formidable, but this is a tight Band 1 fixture where the market has overcorrected for home advantage.

### 🏥 <strong>Team News</strong>

Villa have Kamara and Tielemans fit in midfield. Onana (hamstring) remains out but the squad is largely healthy. Brighton are missing Adam Webster (ACL) and Solly March long-term, with Mitoma close to returning.

### 🧩 <strong>Why This Has Value</strong>

<div class="callout">
Forest's <strong>115-point ELO advantage</strong> over Wolves places this in <strong>Band 3</strong> (101-150 difference). In Band 3 fixtures, the stronger team wins <strong>54.47%</strong> of the time. Bookmakers have Forest at just 45.66% implied — that's a <strong>19% edge</strong> on a team facing the league's worst side.

→ Fair odds = 1 / 0.5447 = 1.84<br>
Bookmaker offering 2.19 = <strong>+19.3% EV</strong>
</div>

### ⚽ <strong>Form Context</strong>

Wolves are in historic crisis. They have 2 points from 13 games — no Premier League team has ever survived from this position. They're winless all season, conceding 2.0 goals per game with a miserable 0.7/10 form rating. Rob Edwards has arrived from Middlesbrough but has had only days to work with the squad.

Forest, despite losing 2-0 to Brighton at the weekend, have shown genuine quality under Dyche. They beat Liverpool 3-0 at Anfield and Leeds 3-1. Their form rating has climbed to 6.8/10 with an improving ELO trajectory.

### 🏥 <strong>Team News</strong>

Wolves are missing Mosquera (ACL), Chiwome (ACL), and González (knee) long-term. Forest have Douglas Luiz (hamstring) and Zinchenko (groin) out, but Chris Wood and Callum Hudson-Odoi should be available.

### 💼 <strong>Portfolio Play</strong>

Pairs with Over 2.5 Goals in same match — correlated but both independently +EV.

### ⚽ <strong>Form Context</strong>

Leeds are struggling in 18th, just 1 point above the drop zone. Daniel Farke is under pressure after 4 consecutive away defeats. They lost 3-2 at City despite a spirited comeback attempt.

### 🏥 <strong>Team News</strong>

Chelsea have Palmer back and a mostly fit squad. Colwill (ACL) is the main long-term absence. Leeds have Calvert-Lewin (adductor) racing to be fit, with Gnonto available.

Fulham have lost 5 consecutive away games and sit 15th, just 1 point above the drop zone. Marco Silva is frustrated with the squad depth.

    <tr><td><strong>Confidence</strong></td><td><strong>Low (longshot)</strong></td></tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### 🧩 <strong>Why This Has Value</strong>

<div class="callout">
Yes, this looks mad. Arsenal are top of the league and unbeaten in 17. But here's the thing: in <strong>Band 5</strong> fixtures (226 ELO difference), the weaker team still wins <strong>14.36%</strong> of the time. Bookmakers are offering 10.14, implying just 9.86%. That's a <strong>46% edge</strong> on a longshot.
</div>

### 📈 <strong>The Model Says</strong>

<div class="callout">
Band 5 (ELO diff 201-250) across 195 matches:<br>
P(Weaker Wins) = 0.1436<br>
→ Fair odds = 6.96<br>
Bookmaker offering 10.14 = massive overlay
</div>

### ⚽ <strong>Form Context</strong>

Let's be clear: Brentford probably lose this. Arsenal are imperious at home. But "probably lose" isn't the same as "definitely lose." Brentford just beat Burnley 3-1 with Igor Thiago scoring twice. They've drawn with Chelsea and beaten Manchester United this season. At these odds, you're being paid handsomely for the small chance they nick something.

### 💼 <strong>Portfolio Play</strong>

This is a high-variance lottery ticket. Small stake (1.5%) is deliberate — the Kelly criterion naturally reduces exposure on low-probability bets. Think of it as a lottery ticket with positive expected value.

## 🧠 <strong>Strategy Notes</strong>

<div class="callout">
<strong>This week's themes:</strong><br>
• Away teams offering massive value (Everton, Villa, Forest, Chelsea, City)<br>
• Goals markets in high-ELO-gap fixtures (Leeds/Chelsea, Wolves/Forest)<br>
• One mathematical longshot (Brentford) worth a small punt<br>
• Avoid the trap bets — Arsenal at 1.30 and Newcastle at 1.70 are both negative EV!
</div>

This is our biggest portfolio of the season at 46.0% exposure across ten bets. That's aggressive, but the edge justifies it — we have a weighted average EV of +14.8%, significantly higher than last week's +8.4%.

The standout theme is **away teams being underpriced**. Everton at 3.54 offers our highest EV of the week — the market is treating this like a foregone Bournemouth win when it's actually a coin-flip Band 1 fixture with Bournemouth missing both strikers. Villa at 3.24 and Forest at 2.19 follow similar logic.

The **Brentford longshot** is our lottery ticket. At 10.14 with a true probability of ~14%, you're getting nearly 46% edge. Will it hit? Probably not. But over hundreds of bets, these positive-EV longshots add up.

**Correlation risk:** We have two bet pairs on the same matches (Wolves/Forest and Leeds/Chelsea, plus Bournemouth/Everton). Accept this correlation given independent +EV on each leg.

Remember: we're playing the long game. Last week we went 3/7 but still made +6.4 units profit. Trust the process.
