<div class="callout">
<strong>International Break Updates</strong><br>
Arsenal's Gabriel injury is the biggest story and actually strengthens our Over 2.5 Goals bet for that match. Bournemouth's Semenyo situation (pending) could strengthen our West Ham bet.
</div>

🔴 <strong>Arsenal vs Spurs — MAJOR IMPACT</strong>
Arsenal's North London Derby preparations have been dealt a devastating blow. Star center-back Gabriel Magalhães sustained a groin/thigh injury in Brazil's friendly against Senegal at the Emirates (ironically) on November 15. Initial examinations suggest he'll miss 4-8 weeks — potentially out until mid-January. Gabriel has been ever-present in the Premier League this season (played every minute) and is crucial to Arsenal's defensive solidity and set-piece threat. The Athletic reports further tests are underway, but best-case scenario is 4 weeks, worst-case is 2 months missing 14+ matches.

Riccardo Calafiori withdrew from Italy duty with a hip problem and returned to London for assessment. Arsenal's defensive crisis now sees them potentially without two key defenders for the biggest game of the season so far.

<strong>Impact on our betting:</strong> Our Arsenal vs Spurs Over 2.5 Goals bet (+8.3% EV) actually becomes <strong>STRONGER.</strong> With Gabriel out, Arsenal's defensive solidity is compromised. Spurs, despite their striker crisis, are more likely to score. The 61.78% Band 5 Over 2.5 probability may increase to 65%+ given Arsenal's weakened backline. This reinforces our goals bet.

🟡 <strong>Bournemouth vs West Ham — MONITORING </strong>
Bournemouth's star forward Antoine Semenyo (6 goals this season) returned early from Ghana duty with a "left anterior talo-fibula ligament sprain" aggravated during the 2-0 friendly loss to Japan. He was substituted 55th minute and missed the South Korea match. However, latest reports suggest this is minor — potentially only a few days out. Justin Kluivert also returned early from Netherlands duty with an injury.

Impact on our betting: Our West Ham Away Win bet (+42.3% EV) becomes <strong>STRONGER</strong> if Semenyo misses out. Bournemouth's striker crisis (both senior strikers Ünal and Evanilson already out long-term) means Semenyo's absence removes their primary goal threat. West Ham's new manager bounce under Nuno becomes even more valuable. <strong>If Semenyo is ruled out, this could move toward +50% EV territory.</strong>

## 🔥 <strong>PREMIUM PICK:</strong> Wolves vs Crystal Palace — <em>Crystal Palace Away Win</em>

  </tbody>

### 🧩 <strong>Why This Has Value</strong>

<div class="callout">
This is the bet of the weekend. Wolves are <strong>bottom of the table with 2 points from 11 games</strong>, facing a Crystal Palace side riding high in 7th place with a <strong>175-point ELO advantage</strong>. This places the fixture firmly in <strong>Band 4</strong> territory, where historically across <strong>235 matches</strong>, the stronger away team wins <strong>64.26%</strong> of the time. Yet bookmakers price Palace at just <strong>52.63% implied probability</strong> — a massive <strong>11.6% gap</strong> creating exceptional value.
</div>

### 📈 <strong>The Model Says</strong>

<div class="callout">
<strong>ELO Difference:</strong> Crystal Palace 1857 vs Wolves 1682 = <strong>175 points</strong><br>
<strong>Band 4 (151-200 ELO diff):</strong> Sample size 235 matches<br>
P(Stronger Away Wins) = 0.6426<br>
→ Fair odds = 1 / 0.6426 = <strong>1.56</strong><br><br>
Bookmaker odds of <strong>1.90</strong> represent significant mispricing:<br>
EV = [(0.6426 × 1.90) - 1] × 100 = <strong>+22.0%</strong><br>
Eighth-Kelly: [(1.90 × 0.6426 - 1) / (1.90 - 1)] / 8 = <strong>5.4%</strong>
</div>

### ⚽ <strong>Form Context</strong>

The contrast couldn't be starker. Palace enter with a perfect <strong>10/10 form rating</strong>, having gone unbeaten through September and currently sitting in Manager of the Month Oliver Glasner's first season. They've won four, drawn five, and lost just two of their eleven matches, conceding only nine goals — the <strong>third-best defensive record</strong> behind Arsenal and Man City. Their recent 3-0 EFL Cup victory at Liverpool showcased their capability against top opposition.

Wolves, meanwhile, are in historic relegation form. <strong>Zero wins, two draws, nine losses</strong> this season. They've scored just seven goals while conceding 25 — both worst in the league. Their <strong>15-game winless run</strong> spans from last season, and they've just appointed Rob Edwards as their third manager of the calendar year following Vitor Pereira's sacking after a winless start. No Premier League team has ever survived with two or fewer points after ten games. They're currently <strong>eight points from safety</strong>.

Palace's ELO has surged <strong>+342 points</strong> over the last five games, while Wolves have declined <strong>-28 points</strong> in their last five and <strong>-41 over ten games</strong>. The momentum is entirely one-way traffic.

### 🏥 <strong>Team News</strong>

Crystal Palace captain <strong>Marc Guehi</strong> suffered a bone bruise to his foot in the 93rd minute against AZ Alkmaar (November 7), initially feared to be a fracture. He was on crutches for two days and "couldn't even walk" according to Glasner, but scans revealed no structural damage. England manager Thomas Tuchel confirmed the injury is "very painful" but Guehi is expected back for this match after missing England's internationals. <strong>Chadi Riad</strong> returned to training November 5 after 10+ months out with an ACL rupture and provides defensive depth.

Wolves' injury crisis compounds their terrible form. <strong>Yerson Mosquera</strong> (ACL & MCL, injured September 21) underwent surgery and is out for the remainder of the season. <strong>Leon Chiwome</strong> (ACL) and <strong>Enso González</strong> (knee) remain long-term absentees. They lost key players in the summer with <strong>Matheus Cunha</strong> and <strong>Rayan Ait-Nouri</strong> sold to Manchester United and Manchester City respectively. New manager Rob Edwards gets approximately ten days with the squad before this fixture — insufficient time to reverse deep-seated issues.

### 💼 <strong>Portfolio Play</strong>

Standalone bet with no correlation concerns. This is the foundation piece of the portfolio with the highest EV. Palace's quality, form, and Wolves' historic struggles create a near-perfect value betting scenario.

### 🧩 <strong>Why This Has Value</strong>

<div class="callout">
Aston Villa's <strong>165-point ELO advantage</strong> over Leeds places this in <strong>Band 3</strong> territory, where the stronger away team wins <strong>54.36%</strong> of the time across <strong>344 historical matches</strong>. The bookmakers have Villa priced at just <strong>42.02% implied</strong>, creating a substantial <strong>12.3% probability gap</strong> and excellent value at 2.38 odds.
</div>

### 📈 <strong>The Model Says</strong>

<div class="callout">
<strong>ELO Difference:</strong> Aston Villa 1886 vs Leeds 1721 = <strong>165 points</strong><br>
<strong>Band 3 (101-150 ELO diff):</strong> Sample size 344 matches<br>

EV = [(0.5436 × 2.38) - 1] × 100 = <strong>+29.4%</strong><br>
Eighth-Kelly: <strong>4.8%</strong>
</div>

### ⚽ <strong>Form Context</strong>

Villa enter in superb form with a <strong>7.7/10 form rating</strong>, having climbed to 5th place in the table. They've won five, drawn three, and lost just three of their eleven matches this season. Their recent form shows <strong>+27 ELO points</strong> over the last five games and <strong>+23 over ten</strong>, indicating sustained quality. The 4-0 demolition of Bournemouth on November 9 showcased their attacking prowess after a 2-0 loss at Liverpool.

Leeds, conversely, are in a relegation dogfight sitting <strong>18th place, just one point above the drop zone</strong>. Manager Daniel Farke is under immense pressure after <strong>four consecutive away defeats</strong> in their last five road games, including a 3-1 loss at Forest, 3-0 at Brighton, and 2-0 at Burnley. Their away form is catastrophic, and their <strong>-21 ELO points over the last five games</strong> demonstrates clear decline. Sky Sports reported November 11 that Farke remains in post, but only their home form is keeping the board's faith.

Villa are averaging <strong>1.3 goals for and 1.0 goals against</strong> over their last ten games, showing both attacking threat and defensive solidity.

### 🏥 <strong>Team News</strong>

Aston Villa face a midfield crisis with both defensive midfielders out long-term. <strong>Boubacar Kamara</strong> and <strong>Amadou Onana</strong> are each 2-3 weeks from return with hamstring injuries. <strong>Tyrone Mings</strong> (hamstring) is out until early January 2026. <strong>Emi Buendía</strong> (foot/ankle) may miss 3+ fixtures. <strong>Pau Torres</strong> (ankle) is sidelined for two months. <strong>Leon Bailey</strong> played the final 15 minutes against Chelsea and could start, while <strong>Ezri Konsa</strong> is back available after serving his red card suspension.

Leeds have injury concerns mounting. <strong>Dominic Calvert-Lewin</strong> (adductor) is "racing against time," uncertain for this fixture. <strong>Sebastiaan Bornauw</strong> (MCL/knee) is day-to-day. <strong>Willy Gnonto</strong> (calf) has been in full team training for 2+ weeks and is expected available.

Despite Villa's injury list, their squad depth still contains significantly more quality than Leeds can muster. The ELO gap reflects this reality.

## 💎 <strong>VALUE PLAY:</strong> Man Utd vs Everton — <em>Everton Away Win</em>

  </tbody>
</table>

### 🧩 <strong>Why This Has Value</strong>

<div class="callout">
This is the highest EV bet of the weekend at <strong>+66.0%</strong>. Man United's <strong>30-point ELO advantage</strong> creates a <strong>Band 1</strong> fixture — essentially a coin flip. In Band 1 across <strong>464 matches</strong>, the weaker away team wins <strong>35.56%</strong> of the time. Yet bookmakers price Everton at just <strong>21.41% implied probability</strong> (4.67 odds) — a massive <strong>14.2% gap</strong>. This is classic public favorite bias. The market sees "Man United at home" and overprices them, creating exceptional value on Everton.
</div>

### 📈 <strong>The Model Says</strong>

<div class="callout">
<strong>ELO Difference:</strong> Man United 1834 vs Everton 1804 = <strong>30 points</strong><br>
<strong>Band 1 (0-50 ELO diff):</strong> Sample size 464 matches<br>

Bookmaker odds of <strong>4.67</strong>:<br>
EV = [(0.3556 × 4.67) - 1] × 100 = <strong>+66.0%</strong><br>
Eighth-Kelly: <strong>6.0%</strong>
</div>

### ⚽ <strong>Form Context</strong>

Man United are on a five-match unbeaten run under Ruben Amorim and sit around 4th-6th position. They've drawn 2-2 with Tottenham (Matthijs de Ligt 96th-minute equalizer) and 2-2 with Forest (Amad Diallo volley rescue), showing resilience if not dominance. They're averaging <strong>1.9 goals for but 1.7 against</strong> — decent going forward but leaky at the back. Their <strong>+36 ELO over the last five games</strong> and <strong>8.6/10 form rating</strong> looks impressive on paper.

But here's the key: <strong>Everton sit 13th with a perfect 10/10 form rating</strong> and have surged <strong>+304 ELO points over the last five games</strong>. Manager David Moyes has stabilized them after a poor start, beating Fulham 2-0 (November 8) and drawing 1-1 at Sunderland. They're resilient and harder to beat than their league position suggests. Averaging <strong>1.1 goals for and 1.2 against</strong> over last ten games shows defensive solidity.

This is a Band 1 fixture where anything can happen. At 4.67 odds, Everton represent outstanding value even if they only win 1 in 3 times — because mathematically they should win closer to 1 in 2.8 times.

### 🏥 <strong>Team News</strong>

Man United have recent concerns with <strong>Benjamin Sesko</strong> (knee) withdrawing from Slovenia duty after a November 8 collision with Van de Ven. Not believed major but requires MRI. Manager Ruben Amorim: "I'm concerned with an injury, because it is in the knee." Expected before this match. <strong>Harry Maguire</strong> and <strong>Casemiro</strong> both forced off 72nd minute vs Tottenham, benefiting from international break for recovery. <strong>Lisandro Martinez</strong> (ACL, out since February) training with Argentina, expected late November/early December return.

Everton have defensive absences with <strong>Jarrad Branthwaite</strong> (hamstring surgery) ruled out indefinitely and <strong>Nathan Patterson</strong> (foot/groin hernia) expected after November break at earliest. <strong>Iliman Ndiaye</strong> overcame thigh issues from Sunderland match. <strong>Kiernan Dewsbury-Hall</strong> returned from 5-yellow suspension.

### 💼 <strong>Portfolio Play</strong>

This is a classic "public fade" bet. Most casual bettors will back Man United at home, allowing the bookmakers to overprice them. We take the other side with a massive mathematical edge. Even if Everton lose 65% of the time, at 4.67 odds we profit long-term.

</div>

### ⚽ <strong>Form Context</strong>

Bournemouth sit 9th with <strong>7W-3D-6L (24 points from 16 matches)</strong>. Their recent 4-0 defeat to Villa (November 9) ended a club-record 8-game unbeaten Premier League streak, but they previously defeated both Arsenal 2-0 and Man City 2-1 this season, reaching as high as 2nd in the table. <strong>Antoine Semenyo</strong> in excellent form with 6 goals. Their <strong>5.6/10 form rating</strong> and <strong>+6 ELO last 5 games</strong> shows recent stability.

West Ham sit 17th but crucially have a perfect <strong>10/10 form rating</strong> under new manager Nuno Espírito Santo (appointed late October). They secured their first two wins as manager — 3-1 vs Newcastle (Nov 3), 3-2 vs Burnley (Nov 8) — and are climbing from the bottom three. The <strong>+238 ELO surge over last 5 games</strong> is remarkable, showing genuine improvement. Averaging <strong>1.0 goals for and 2.1 against</strong> over last ten, but recent form suggests defensive improvement.

This is Band 2 where upsets happen regularly. West Ham's new manager bounce and momentum makes them live underdogs at huge odds.

### 🏥 <strong>Team News</strong>

Bournemouth are dealing with a striker crisis. Both senior strikers unavailable: <strong>Enes Ünal</strong> (ACL) out for entire season, <strong>Evanilson</strong> (fractured metatarsal) had surgery with no return timeframe. <strong>Adam Smith</strong> suffered suspected concussion from collision in Villa loss. <strong>Lewis Cook</strong> (shoulder ligaments) hoped to return after international break. Manager Andoni Iraola called set-piece defending "unacceptable" after conceding 3 from dead balls vs Villa.

West Ham have positive injury news. <strong>Niclas Füllkrug</strong> (muscle/thigh) progressing with group training, expected after break. <strong>Konstantinos Mavropanos</strong> (leg) still on individual training, expected after break. <strong>Lucas Paquetá</strong> accumulated 5th yellow vs Burnley, suspended for this match — significant loss. <strong>Crysencio Summerville</strong> returned and available. Manager Nuno praised <strong>Freddie Potts</strong> extensively after his performance, emphasizing need for young players.

Bournemouth's striker crisis against West Ham's momentum creates opportunity for the away side at massive odds.

### ⚽ <strong>Form Context</strong>

Fulham sit 15th with 11 points, just 1 point above the drop zone, in a relegation battle. They have <strong>5 consecutive away defeats</strong> — worst road form under Marco Silva. Recent results: lost 2-0 at Everton (Nov 8), beat Wolves 3-0 at home (Nov 1). Manager Silva frustrated post-Everton: "Not good enough in terms of performance or result...we got what we deserved." Averaging <strong>1.1 goals for and 1.5 against</strong> over last ten — vulnerable defensively but capable of scoring at home.

Sunderland are the surprise package sitting <strong>4th place (6W-1D-4L, 19 points)</strong> — exceptional for a promoted side. <strong>Unbeaten in 19 matches overall</strong>, drawing last 17 consecutively including dramatic 2-2 vs Arsenal (Nov 8) with late equalizer. Youngest team in Premier League performing beyond expectations under Régis Le Bris. Averaging <strong>1.3 goals for and 0.9 against</strong> — attacking threat with defensive organization. Their <strong>10/10 form rating</strong> and <strong>+58 ELO last 5 games</strong> shows they're genuine.

Band 3 fixtures with these goal-scoring profiles tend to be open, attacking matches. Both sides will fancy their chances, creating opportunities at both ends.

### 🏥 <strong>Team News</strong>

Fulham missing <strong>Antonee Robinson</strong> (knee surgery) targeting mid-December return — he provided 10 assists last season. <strong>Raúl Jiménez</strong> (hip) close to return, expected late November. <strong>Sasa Lukic</strong> on 4 yellows (one from suspension).

Sunderland have <strong>Omar Alderete</strong> (concussion) expected late November after still experiencing symptoms. <strong>Habib Diarra</strong> (groin surgery/fibula) targeting early December. <strong>Romaine Mundle</strong> (hamstring) close to playing after surgery. <strong>Noah Sadiki</strong> and <strong>Granit Xhaka</strong> both one yellow away from bans.

Both teams capable of scoring, both with defensive vulnerabilities, in a match that should be open and entertaining.

### ⚽ <strong>Form Context</strong>

Man City sit 2nd in the table, 4 points behind Arsenal after their 3-0 Liverpool win (November 9) on Guardiola's 1000th game as manager. Also beat Dortmund 4-1, Bournemouth 3-1. <strong>Erling Haaland</strong> prolific with 13 PL goals in 10 appearances. <strong>Phil Foden</strong> back to best form with 2 goals vs Dortmund. Their <strong>8.8/10 form rating</strong> and <strong>+38 ELO last 5 games</strong> shows they're hitting peak form. Averaging <strong>1.9 goals for and 0.8 against</strong> — dominant at both ends.

Newcastle sit 14th but have shown glimpses of quality in Champions League (three consecutive wins including 2-0 vs Athletic Bilbao). Their away form is poor (lost 3-1 at Brentford, 3-1 at West Ham), but <strong>at home</strong> they're a different proposition. Manager Eddie Howe acknowledged "our away form hasn't been good enough" but St James' Park remains a fortress where they create chances. Averaging <strong>1.1 goals for</strong> over last ten suggests they'll threaten City's defense.

Both teams score, both teams attack. In a high-quality Band 3 fixture at Newcastle's home ground, BTTS looks solid value.

### 🏥 <strong>Team News</strong>

Man City nearly full strength. <strong>Mateo Kovacic</strong> (Achilles with calcification) only long-term absence, expected February/March 2026. <strong>Rodri</strong> (hamstring) returned to training but not 100%, likely available after break. Guardiola won't risk him ahead of international break.

Newcastle dealing with illness outbreak affecting <strong>Sandro Tonali</strong>, <strong>Jacob Murphy</strong>, <strong>Kieran Trippier</strong>, <strong>Bruno Guimarães</strong>. <strong>Yoane Wissa</strong> (knee, £55m summer signing) yet to debut, expected late November. <strong>Anthony Gordon</strong> (hip/groin) withdrew from England squad, described as "minor." <strong>Joelinton</strong> (calf) limped off first half vs Brentford, not expected long-term. <strong>Dan Burn</strong> red card suspension, missing this crucial match.

Despite Newcastle's issues, they have attacking quality to score at home. City will dominate but are unlikely to keep a clean sheet.

### ⚽ <strong>Form Context</strong>

Arsenal lead the table with a commanding six-point advantage after 11 games. Their remarkable 14-match unbeaten run (winning 10 straight and keeping 8 consecutive clean sheets) ended with a 2-2 draw at Sunderland on November 9. Despite that setback, they remain dominant with <strong>+22 ELO over last 5 games</strong>. Averaging <strong>1.9 goals for and just 0.5 against</strong> over last ten — exceptional attacking output. Their set-piece dominance continues with 12 goals from dead balls (most in league).

Spurs sit 5th with <strong>5W-3D-3L (18 points)</strong> but wildly inconsistent. Their home form is catastrophic — only 5 points from 5 home matches (1W-2D-3L), only 3 home wins in the entire calendar year of 2025. However, they score goals: averaging <strong>1.6 goals for</strong> over last ten. Manager Thomas Frank under pressure with fans booing during matches. Their 0-1 loss to Chelsea produced lowest xG (0.05) since Opta records began in 2012-13.

North London Derbies are typically open, high-scoring affairs. Arsenal will dominate and create numerous chances. Spurs, despite their struggles, always raise their game for the derby and have attacking quality to threaten. Three or more goals feels highly likely.

### 🏥 <strong>Team News</strong>

Arsenal face crucial injury crisis. Five key players targeting returns: <strong>Viktor Gyökeres</strong> (hamstring), captain <strong>Martin Ødegaard</strong> (MCL knee), <strong>Kai Havertz</strong> (knee), <strong>Noni Madueke</strong> (knee) all expected back for November 23. <strong>Gabriel Martinelli</strong> (muscular) has no confirmed return. Manager Arteta: "everything has to be perfect" for injured players to return. If Arsenal get even three back, they'll create even more chances.

Spurs' striker crisis compounds issues. <strong>Randal Kolo Muani</strong> (broken jaw) forced off at half-time vs Man United, out 6-8 weeks until early January. <strong>Dominic Solanke</strong> (ankle, August surgery) Frank hopes returns after break. <strong>Yves Bissouma</strong> (ankle ligament) underwent surgery, "out for weeks." <strong>Rodrigo Bentancur</strong> serving 7-match domestic ban for racial slur.

Despite Spurs' striker issues, they still have <strong>Mohammed Kudus</strong> fit (Frank "very confident" for Arsenal after knock) and attacking midfielders capable of scoring. Open game expected.

## 🧠 <strong>Strategy Notes</strong>

This week's portfolio presents exceptional value driven by two primary market inefficiencies. First, bookmakers are systematically underpricing away underdogs in Band 1 and Band 2 fixtures. The public reflexively backs big-name home teams like Man United and Bournemouth, allowing oddsmakers to overprice favorites and underprice quality away sides. Everton at +66.0% EV and West Ham at +42.3% EV represent textbook examples of this bias. Both teams are in excellent form (10/10 ratings), both face home sides separated by minimal ELO gaps, yet both are priced as if they're massive underdogs.

<div class="callout">
<strong>This week's edge:</strong><br>
• Bookmakers overvaluing home advantage in close matchups<br>
• Public bias toward big-name clubs (Man United, Bournemouth) creating value on opposition<br>
• Goals markets underpriced on high-quality fixtures (Arsenal/Spurs, Newcastle/City, Fulham/Sunderland)<br>
• Four away win bets showing exceptional value across different ELO bands
</div>

The second inefficiency is in goals markets for high-quality fixtures. Arsenal vs Spurs in the North London Derby, Newcastle hosting Man City in a top-6 clash, and Fulham hosting confident promoted side Sunderland all show the bookmakers underpricing scoring potential. When teams with attacking quality meet, especially in derby or high-stakes matches, the intensity and end-to-end nature creates goal-scoring opportunities the odds don't fully reflect.

**Portfolio construction is deliberately balanced**: four match result bets (all away wins), three goals/BTTS bets. The away win bets are independent events across different fixtures, providing excellent diversification. The goals bets add variety without correlation to the match result bets — Over 2.5 Goals can hit regardless of which team wins.

**Stake sizing uses eighth-Kelly** (dividing the optimal Kelly stake by 8 rather than 2) to provide extra bankroll protection given the variance in football betting. Total exposure of 30.1% is moderate and sustainable even through losing runs. The highest individual stake is 6.0% on Everton — justified by the massive +66.0% EV but still conservative enough to weather multiple losses.

The standout plays are the two highest-EV bets: <strong>Everton away at 4.67 odds</strong> and <strong>West Ham away at 5.12 odds</strong>. These are classic "ugly" value bets that most casual bettors will ignore. Everton playing at Old Trafford? Most people automatically back United. West Ham visiting Bournemouth after Bournemouth's 8-game unbeaten streak? Most assume Bournemouth wins. But the math says otherwise. These Band 1 and Band 2 fixtures are much closer to coin flips than the odds suggest, creating exceptional long-term value for disciplined bettors.

Crystal Palace at Wolves (+22.0% EV) and Aston Villa at Leeds (+29.4% EV) offer similar logic but with stronger favorites. Palace and Villa are genuinely better teams with massive ELO advantages (175 and 165 points respectively), facing opposition in relegation form. These are higher-probability bets at shorter odds, balancing the portfolio with some "safer" value plays alongside the longer-shot underdogs.

> <em>Remember: positive EV is a long-term edge. Everton will likely lose at Old Trafford. West Ham will probably lose at Bournemouth. Palace might draw with Wolves. Any individual bet can lose. But if we make these bets 100 times at these odds, we profit significantly. That's the discipline of value betting — taking prices the market has wrong, regardless of whether the team "should" win.</em>

**Total Bankroll Exposure:** 30.1%  
**Expected Profit:** +8.16% of bankroll this weekend (30.1% × 27.1% = 8.16% expected return)

Seven bets. Four away underdogs, three goals markets. All showing genuine mathematical edge. The market has mispriced these opportunities due to public bias and goals market inefficiency. We take advantage and let the numbers work over time.
