I spent, at least, half of last month travelling. As a result, I put a few projects on hold for some much needed RnR.

Feeling well rested,, and having expanded my pen collection quite significantly during the trip (more on this later), I was pumped to get *back to the grind*. 

I needed some great pens to help me get back into the flow. I think I succeeded in that.

This pen, for a while after I bought it, was a pain in my ass. 

It just *wouldn't write*. I soaked it overnight, cleaned it with dish soap, and even learnt Italian so I could plead with it in case it wasn't understanding my desperate English pleas.

Not what you'd expect from an (almost) Â£400 pen.

...Or maybe you do - I'm looking at you, Visconti!!!

I reached out to the very friendly bunch at Montegrappa UK and sent it to them to get fixed. They determined that there was a bit of plastic that hadn't been cut in the manufacturing process, and this was what was preventing ink to flow into the feed. 

Hey - these things happen!

They swapped the nib section with a new one and I could now write with the pen. Problem solved.

It wrote wonderfully once returned, but I had developed a preference for fine nibs, and so I've ground this one down myself. I think I may even go further one day.

---
**Design**

At some point Montegrappa have changed their nibs on the NeroUno, and the one that was sent back to me was a different design to the original. I don't know whether I have an old NeroUno nib, or an old one.

The original nib I had was longer/slimmer and more ornate than the one I have now. I was told that the nib would be swapped out, and I'm not complaining because an ugly nib that writes is better than the prettiest nib that doesn't write.

...Unless it's a nib with "Iridium point Germany" stamped on it. I don't have many snooty pen opinions, but IPG nibs make my skin crawl.

This nib definitely isn't ugly. It's plain and simple, but the way it sits makes it stand out. Couple this with the gorgeous barrel design and you have something really beautiful.

There's some grandeur about this pen; something imposing and encapsulating about it. I imagine it would have a bit of an ego, but can you blame it?

The NeroUno is the base model design, while the Linea is a bit more expensive and features the barrel slits. Or the *lineas*, I guess.

Whether the difference in price is quite worth it is up for debate, but in my opinion it just looks better. Montegrappa clearly are aware of this. 

The grooves aren't sharp and I've not found them to collect dirt or dust, as they're not deep enough to catch anything substantial.

## TWSBI 580
**Specifications:**
- Filling System: Piston
- Nib: Architect (modified)
- Nib material: Steel
- Price Range: Â£53
- Ink: <span style="color:red;">Pelikan Edelstein Garnet</span>

The third pen that I bought into the start of my fountain pen fascination. It was also my first piston filler.

- [x] [main shot of pen] pic

Come to think of it, the first ink that I put in it was also red; the more vibrant Diamine Red Dragon. 

It's been a workhorse in my collection for ten years, and over that time it's seen a number of different inks (not all red), as well as a new nib. 

- [x] [close up of ink in barrel] pic

There was a point when I started to go a bit mad and was switching nibs between different pens, as well as grinding my own, as I discussed with my Montegrappa. This pen seems to have inherited a Schmidt gold-plated steel nib, which I ground into an architect. 

There is something about this pen that just makes sense for it to have an architect grind. Maybe it's been in it so long and I've just associated it with such a shape?

- [x] [close up of nib] pic

I think some work could be done to make it a bit more architect-y, but I'll hold off on doing that for the time being.

If it ain't broke, don't fix it (unlike my Montegrappa).

## Pelikan "Piccadilly Circus" M620
**Specifications:**
- Filling System: Piston
- Nib: Fine
- Nib material: Gold
- Price Range: Â£300
- Ink: <span style="color:saddlebrown;">Caran d'Ache Organic Brown</span>

A pen friend at the London Pen Club sold this to me, and I was overjoyed to get my hands on it. 

- [ ] [writing sample pic] -- have it written about London; caption about the ink

I didn't realise this until writing this post, but perhaps it's a slight Freudian slip that I chose this pen to ink up just after having travelled up and down northern Europe.

I grew up just outside of London, but still within the bounds of the M25. In my teenage years, I would inevitably go to visit the city regularly, as it was quite literally on my doorstep.

Some of my best memories at the time were in London. I was (and remain) amazed by such a great city. Naturally, I wanted to demonstrate this admiration in pen form. 

- [ ] [main shot of pen] pic

The **M620 Piccadilly Circus** is part of the *City* series that Pelikan introduced in 2001. Perhaps the most famous would be the Grand Place (Brussels), with New York (model eponymously named!) coming in second place. 

I don't know where in the favourites-ranking people would vote this, but it was the penultimate pen in the series and was released in 2006. With its blue, red, and pink swirls that resemble the bustling and vibrant Piccadilly Circus centre, it still stands out amongst all the other beautiful designs within the series. 

Yes, there's some grey in the design - I assume this is a nod to the dull and grey British weather.

Interestingly, this is an M620. The Mxx0 in regular Pelikan numbering would suggest this should have gold hardware (with Mxx5 being silver). I think gold would be far too gaudy, but it does have the gold-motif nib that the Mxx0 series has. I imagine that because this is a special edition (denoted by the Mx2x), this rule isn't as hardy. Still, an interesting point to note.

I said that many of my best memories are in London, and this is still the case. I'm lucky to be living right in the heart of this great city, with a great partner in crime, and having a great time!

Great stuff!

## Uni-Ball One P
**Specifications:**
- Type: Gel Pen
- Nib: 0.38mm
- Price Range: Â£5-7
- Ink: Uni-Ball "Super Ink"

This is the pen I've been carrying around with me as a non-fountain pen option. I am utterly in love with it. 

- [ ] [peach milk] pic

So in love with it that when I lost it on the Tube, I immediately bought another one and was writing with it once again after it was delivered the next day (thanks, Bezos!)

It's a short pen. I imagine the "-P" stands for *petite*, or something, as there is a larger version that is simply called the *One*

- [ ] [model comparison] pic

The first pen I had was the Peach Milk model with a 0.38mm nib; the one I have now is the Grape with a 0.5mm nib. I think I might *just* prefer the purple, but I certainly enjoy the finer nib in the pen that I lost.

One of these days I'll get another **One P**, and then most likely a few more after that. So I have no doubt that, due to the miracle of consumer capitalism (er.. thanks again, Jeff), I'll end up with another Peach Milk.
