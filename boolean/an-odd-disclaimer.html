        <p class="lead-text">
          This is a pet project of mine that began in 2022 and it exists because I'm a massive nerd who loves three things: football, statistics, and that sweet dopamine hit of finding a bet that the bookies have undervalued (ha, idiots!).

          This is about the journey of a self-taught coder who got obsessed with the idea that football, for all its beautiful chaos, might just be a tiny bit predictable.

          What started as a humble spreadsheet has evolved into a full-blown statistical analysis engine. Every week, my model wakes up, stretches its digital limbs, and goes hunting across the Premier League website for fresh data. Goals, cards, possession stats ‚Äì if it happened on the pitch, my script knows about it.

                The philosophy is simple: If teams with a 200-point ELO difference have historically resulted in home wins 67% of the time, and the bookies are offering odds that imply only 55%...

        <!-- Question 2: ELO -->
        <div class="faq-card">
          <h3 class="faq-question">What's this ELO thing you keep banging on about?</h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              ELO isn't an acronym (despite what it looks like) ‚Äì it's named after Arpad Elo, an absolute legend who created this rating system for chess. The concept is wonderfully simple:
            </p>
            
            <ul class="elo-list">
              <li>Every team starts with a rating (usually around 1500)</li>
              <li class="win-strong">Beat a strong team? Your rating goes up loads</li>
              <li class="win-weak">Beat a weak team? Your rating goes up a bit</li>
              <li class="lose-weak">Lose to a weak team? Your rating plummets faster than Manchester United's title hopes</li>
              <li class="lose-strong">Lose to a strong team? Meh, expected that, rating drops slightly</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>
              Think of it like a constantly updating "how good is this team RIGHT NOW" score.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              It's dynamic, it's mathematical, and it doesn't give a toss what Gary Lineker thinks, which, let's be honest, is probably for the best.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              The beauty is that ELO self-corrects. If a team goes on a mad run (looking at you, Leicester in 2016), their ELO shoots up. Hit a rough patch (hello, Chelsea in 2022)? It drops...
            </p>
            
            <p>
              ...it's like the stock market, but for football teams.
            </p>

        <!-- Question 3: Poisson -->
        <div class="faq-card">
          <h3 class="faq-question">And Poisson? Ain't that a fish?</h3>
          <div class="faq-answer">
            <p>
              Named after the mathematician, Simeon Denis Poisson (English translation: Simon Dennis Fish).
            </p>
            
            <p>
              The Poisson distribution is this brilliant bit of statistics that predicts rare events. And let's face it, scoring a goal in football is pretty rare...
            </p>
            
            <p class="joke-text">
              ...just ask any West Ham fan.
            </p>
            
            <p>Here's the deal: If we know a team averages 1.5 goals per match, Poisson can tell us:</p>
            
            <div class="poisson-stats">
              <div class="stat-item">
                <span class="stat-prob">~22%</span>
                <span class="stat-label">Probability of scoring 0 goals</span>
              </div>
              <div class="stat-item">
                <span class="stat-prob">~33%</span>
                <span class="stat-label">Probability of scoring 1 goal</span>
              </div>
              <div class="stat-item">
                <span class="stat-prob">~25%</span>
                <span class="stat-label">Probability of scoring 2 goals</span>
              </div>
              <div class="stat-item">
                <span class="stat-prob">~20%</span>
                <span class="stat-label">Probability of scoring 3+ goals</span>
              </div>
            </div>
            
            <p>
              Now multiply those probabilities for both teams, and boom! You've got a full matrix of potential scorelines.
            </p>
            
            <p>
              The model uses this to generate those fancy score matrices you see on the site.
