# Matchweek 28 Thoughts

## Wolves v Aston Villa
If you told me this was a +EV bet back in [Matchweek 18](https://ferret-stack.github.io/Matchweek-18) I would have jumped at this. 

Wolves were in dire straits; I don't know if they'd actually *won* a game by this point or not. Yet their form has slowly been picking up; their stable 5.4 is better than Villa's 4.6 

[CLAUDE: Is there any statistics we can run on this? Dive into the data in the project files and look at any interesting trends in the recent changes in ELO rating for the two teams; list what we can derive and then also list interesting "tid bits" we can mention, though this should still focus on quantitative.. do you understand?]

Although, there's only so far you can go down. Unai losing this would certainly be a "bad ebening" for Unai's side and although they are away, 11% EV on the stronger team in a Band 6 is very good; we estimate this hits 60% of the time, while bookies expect; we only need to be right x/10

[CLAUDE: any interesting goal markets? What would the xG be of this given what's at stake for each team, manager styles, and data.. I have a feeling this will be low scoring; what is Villa's scoring average like this season and how does this match up to Wolves' defence? Poisson is interesting]

## Bournemouth v Sunderland

These teams are pretty far apart geographically, but in terms of ELO only 20 points separates these two teams

Bournemouth has turned it around after a slightly poor form up to the middle of the season and recovering rom striker loss

Sunderland started off strong, but it appears they're losing steam; a falling 2.8/10 form rating isn't too impressive (and really puts into context the Wolves figures)

I think we should mark this in our spreadsheet tracker that I track bets - it is useful to have in our database to analyse.. Instances where Band 1 fixtures but poor form games, whether it is optimal to make these bets?

Still, until we have the data there, we shall follow our current methodology. We'll put a sixteenth Kelly on this given the high EV but poor form; we expect a rocky ride and we plan accordingly

[CLAUDE: What would we estimate our "true EV" to be in this situation - can we use form in the future as a way to update the WDL percentages? Could we quantitatively track this? I am all about making improvements in the model]

Higher EV, but we're expecting this to hit a lot less often than the Villa 

## Burnley v Brentford | Leeds v Man City | Brighton v Forest
Boring

## Newcastle v Everton
Everton were convincing against Man Utd last week; it was balanced on a knife's edge and was looking like the toffees could nab one, but it wasn't to be 

Everton +EV here 

[CLAUDE: What is Newcastle's performance been like lately? Everton's 6/10 form is higher, there's not much in it ELO wise, and you could argue that the way Everton played against Man Utd could add an extra 0.1-0.3 points in form]

## Liverpool v West Ham
Draw and West Ham win +EV

40% chance of either hitting

[CLAUDE: What are good double chance odds here]

Liverpool stronger form, though West Ham battling; Liverpool struggled against Forest away

## Man Utd v Palace
Palace at 96% EV here which is insane; draw marginally +EV too

Combining these two bets we would still get over 50% likelihood

The +EV is because of Palace's form, though it's saying stable, the more recent span of games suggest it should be a bit lower?

## Fulham v Spurs
lol. More chance Wolves beating Villa

## Arsenal v Chelsea
Arsenal punished one London rival recently.. Idk is this one worth it?
